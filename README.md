# 🦕 Hi, I'm Veiston

I build software, local‑first AI, 3D, and robotics. I like tinkering with small, useful things and keeping things simple.
I love to create projects to help me in my own life, be it watering my plants automatically or doing quantitive financial analysis for smarter market decisions.
